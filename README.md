# CS300-Project-2

•	What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
For this course, the projects aimed at analyzing and choosing the best data structure that will serve the ABCU project. Course information were stored in a csv text file. The program needed to read course information from the file, insert them in course objects, and loading them in a data structure that allows for efficient insertion, retrieval, and sorting.

•	How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
Project 1 helped in breaking down the requirements of the program. It also helped me determine the best data structure to use for project 2. It is important to understand data structures because they will be chosen depending on what operations the program needed to perform. For example, the ABCU project only required insertion, search and sorting. The run-time analysis document explains why I ended up choosing a binary search tree.

•	How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I started by testing with print statements, the function that read the data from the file and created course objects with each course information. It was a trial-and-error process that led me to the final code that I submitted. Once that function was working as expected, the rest was straightforward. It just needed some debugging to correct some statements and some logic and syntax errors.

•	How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
One of the common errors beginner students and programmers do is to start writing code right away without preplanning or thinking the problem through. This course emphasized the importance of problem-solving skills using pseudocode. Pseudocode helps you break down your problem and analyze the different steps needed to solve it. One done, writing code becomes more of a translation process from pseudocode to the language’s syntax.

•	How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This is the first major problem where I am not provided with a starter code that only needs some fixes. Trying to write a program from scratch that had to solve different problems (unlike practice exercises that are short and usually try to solve a single problem) was a challenge. Analyzing the requirements, choosing the right data structure, and planning ahead helped me evolve the way I write maintainable, readable and adaptable programs.
